Unfinished code from my Senior Design Project at Syracuse University as a Computer Engineer student. I was trying to write a skeleton of code for our project which was an automatic Rubix cube solver. This code would include matrix manipulation for scrambling/solving the cube, using OpenCV to read the colors of each side of the cube to determine the next move, serial communication to use Arduino to turn the motors, and threading to speed up the image processing.
